**Common Issues:**

Alright, let's dissect this coding catastrophe, shall we? Here's the recurring theme: you seem to have a penchant for global styles, `!important` declarations, and generally ignoring the cascade. I'm also picking up a strong "copy-paste-and-hope-for-the-best" vibe, especially when it comes to responsive design and adding new styles. And someone needs to learn about CSS specificity before the cascade reclaims them. You also apparently love throwing everything AND the kitchen sink when it comes to library imports. Did you forget to validate user input?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Specificity Wars are for Losers:** Embrace CSS specificity. Learn to use the cascade to your advantage, not fight against it with `!important` and overly broad selectors. Think more, copy-paste less.
2.  **Validation is Your Friend:** User input validation isn't optional. It's the difference between a working application and a security nightmare.
3.  **Think Before You Style:** Avoid global style resets unless you *really* know what you're doing. Scope your styles and avoid unnecessary `!important` declarations. They're a cry for help, not a badge of honor.
4.  **Responsive Design... Responsibly:** Stop relying on magic numbers and media query overload. Use more flexible approaches like `min-width` / `max-width` and container queries where appropriate.
5.  **Library Management:** Just because a library *exists* doesn't mean you need to include it. Analyze your dependencies and only import what you *actually* use. Tree-shaking is your friend.
6.  **Don't Hardcode Everything:** User experience relies on *options*. If categories are hardcoded, expect users to be a little angry.
